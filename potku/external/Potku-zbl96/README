        Zbl96 is a program for calculating electronic and nuclear
        stopping powers according to the semiempirical model of
        Ziegler, Biersack and Littmark.

        This program is based on the version 96 of Srim-code.

Insallation:

	- Copy parameter-files mass93.str, scoef.95a and scoef.95b somewhere
        - Change the file path in local.h accordingly

        - Run make to get zbl96 binary

        - Run make lib to get libzb96.a -binary

	- Run make testlib to compile an example of using the library

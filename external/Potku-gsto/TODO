TODO

- sane installation to whatever prefix (e.g. /usr/local)
- stopping.txt should be stopping.cfg in either the prefix (see above) or in $HOME
- stopping in different y-units (eV/(10e15 at/cm^2), keV/(ug/cm^2), etc...)
- internal units completely to SI (currently dE/dx is eV/10^15 at/cm^2)
- unambiguous, systematic and clear naming of functions, constants, variables
- more options to interface (efficient generation of stopping tables in various units)
- ability to remove stopping files (currently you can only add)
- benchmarking, optimizations
- alternative storage of stopping data in memory (conversion at read time)
- inclusion of different stopping force databases (other than SRIM)
- ability to do simple stopping calculations (stopping in layers etc)
- correction factors to stopping (user preference)
- partial loading of stopping (different energies for same Z1-Z2 combination from different sources)
- straggling libraries as well
- advanced interpolation (splines?)

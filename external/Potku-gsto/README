Introduction
-------------- 

The purpose of this library is to provide other programs with stopping (-dE/dx)
forces. The program is under construction, so no proper documentation is
available currently. It is however the intention of the author to use simple
data formats which should be self explanatory when examples are given.


Installation
--------------

Assuming a sane environment with gcc and make and other relevant tools running
"make" will make AND install the library AND the auxiliary programs.

Build the library only with "make lib" and "make lib_install". Note that the
library is currently tailored to the needs of the Potku software and therefore
the installation procedure does not actually conform to any conventions.


Usage
--------------

stopping.txt contains a list of stopping files along with information which
stopping (Z1, Z2 combinations) they are assigned to.  The file should be self
explanatory. Each Z1, Z2 combination when automatically assigned will be
assigned to a the stopping file that is first suitable file in the list. The
library can also be used in a way which allows manual assignments.


Stopping data
--------------

Several file formats are and will be supported. Mainly ascii formats. A
generator is included, which should be used for reference until a proper
reference is finalized.


Limitations
-------------

Several. See TODO.
